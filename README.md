# citibike_project
Using the Citibike dataset, I will work on my SQL and Python skills to make sense of the data.

Steps of the project are outlined below:
1. Identify and download the data
2. Examine pattern of headers of CSV
3. Combine CSVs that have the same headers
4. Rectify the mistakes between the groups of CSVs to preserve as much data as possible
5. Normalize tables to prepare to...
6. ...Make SQL database
7. Run SQL queries either in Jupyter Lab or in MySQLWorkbench
8. Model data in Python and use OpenStreetMap
